# Plugin template for Jeak plugins
Users can create new plugins from this template repository either by manual cloning or via the templating mechanism of GitHub.  

## How to use the template
1. Set your plugin ID in ``project.ext => artifact``. It will be used to generate the plugin Jar file.  
2. Create your plugin package below ``src/main/java/`` (convention here is to use reverse domain notation here too)
3. Create your plugin class in ``src/main/java/<your-package>``  
4. Happy programming! :) (Remember to visit [the documentation](https://jeakbot.readme.io) and feel free to ask for help in case you need it)
